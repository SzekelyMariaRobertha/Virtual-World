## Usage

### Scenario
The scene includes a series of mountain peaks next to a river. Also, a road bridge crosses it. Next to this one is placed a gas station for those who arrive here, but also a police station to prevent troubles. 

Moreover, the stage has a space arranged for a small airport. The other one side of the river there is a village that includes a series of houses, a church and even a lake where you can skate. The whole scene is surrounded by tall trees that give the scene a believable character.

### Features
The user has the possibility to view the scene in several ways: Solid, Wireframe, Poligonal and Smooth.
Also, the user can move through the scene using the keys. It can go forward, backward, left, right and even rotate around the X and Y axes. Moreover, you can control the directional light within the scene, to better observe the point source of light. You will also be able to activate the fog effect and observe a series of animations such as the plane on the runway and a dancer skating on the lake.
